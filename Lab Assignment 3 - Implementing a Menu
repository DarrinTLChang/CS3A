    Submitted by Darrin Chang
    Submitted: April 26th, 2024

    Assignment 3: Code is added to the program in order to create a menu of functions which the user can choose from

    Assignment 2: Additional code is added to this program in order to convert the user's input from Celsius to Celsius,
    Kelvin, or Fahrenheit

    Assignment 1: This program demonstrates printing lines of text to the screen
