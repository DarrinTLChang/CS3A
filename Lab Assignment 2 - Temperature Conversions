Assignment Two: Temperature Conversions
Submitted by Darrin Chang
Submitted: April 19th, 2024

Assignment 2: Additional code is added to this program in order to convert the user's input from Celsius to Celsius,
Kelvin, or Fahrenheit

Assignment 1: This program demonstrates printing lines of text to the screen
