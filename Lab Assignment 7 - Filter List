    Assignment Seven: Filter List
    Submitted by Darrin Chang
    Submitted: May 24th, 2024

    Assignment 7: This assignment introduces two methods (in detail)
              print_filter() - prints a list of sensors that are active and inactive
              change_filter() - allows a user to activate a sensor or deactivate it
              The change_filter() is initiated through the menu prompt #3 choice.
              The change_filter() method will print the filter list showing active or
              inactive states, and it will allow the user to turn a sensor on or off.

    Assignment 6: Bubble sort a sensor list but using recursion. Use a test case
              as provided (similar to assignment 5, but with reference to the
              sensor list information from assignment 4).

    Assignment 5: A separate recursion assignment (as another project; see assignment 5)

    Assignment 4: Code is added to create a sensor list and filter list

    Assignment 3: Code is added to the program in order to create a menu of functions which the user can choose from

    Assignment 2: Additional code is added to this program in order to convert the user's input from Celsius to Celsius,
    Kelvin, or Fahrenheit

    Assignment 1: This program demonstrates printing lines of text to the screen
